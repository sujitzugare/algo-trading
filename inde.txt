This is a great question. Having to run two separate commands in two terminals is inconvenient.

The easiest solution is to create a single **Windows Batch Script**. This is a simple text file that will run *both* commands for you, each in its own new window.

Here is your "cheat sheet" for all operations.

### 1\. Manual Commands (What you are doing now)

This is just for your reference.

  * **To START the Bot:**
      * In **Terminal 1**, run:
        ```cmd
        C:/Users/sujit/AppData/Local/Programs/Python/Python312/python.exe "c:/Users/sujit/Downloads/sdfsd/New folder (2)/gme/qunts/fff/new/spec/trading_bot.py" webhook
        ```
  * **To START the Tunnel:**
      * In **Terminal 2**, run:
        ```cmd
        cloudflared tunnel --url http://localhost:5000
        ```
  * **To STOP everything:**
      * You must close **both** terminal windows.

### 2\. The 1-Click Solution (The Batch Script)

Follow these steps to create a single file that does all the work.

1.  Go to your trading bot folder (the one containing `trading_bot.py`).
2.  Right-click, select **New** -\> **Text Document**. 3.  Name this new file **`start_bot.bat`** (make sure you change the file extension from `.txt` to `.bat`). Windows may warn you about changing the extension; click "Yes".
4.  Right-click on your new `start_bot.bat` file and click **"Edit"**.
5.  Copy and paste the following code into the file:

<!-- end list -->

```bat
@echo off
title Trading Bot Manager

echo =======================================================
echo  Starting Python Bot and Cloudflare Tunnel...
echo =======================================================

echo.
echo [1/2] Starting Python Trading Bot in a new window...
start "Python Bot" C:/Users/sujit/AppData/Local/Programs/Python/Python312/python.exe "c:/Users/sujit/Downloads/sdfsd/New folder (2)/gme/qunts/fff/new/spec/trading_bot.py" webhook

echo [2/2] Starting Cloudflare Tunnel in a new window...
start "Cloudflare Tunnel" cloudflared tunnel --url http://localhost:5000

echo.
echo =======================================================
echo  DONE! 
echo  Two new windows have been opened.
echo  You can close this window now.
echo =======================================================
pause
```

6.  **Save** and close the file.

### How to Use Your New Script

Now, your entire process is just two simple steps:

  * **To START everything:**

      * Go to your folder and **double-click the `start_bot.bat` file**.
      * It will open two new, separate terminal windows (one for the bot, one for the tunnel) and run them automatically.

  * **To STOP everything:**

      * Simply **close the two new terminal windows** that the script opened.\
